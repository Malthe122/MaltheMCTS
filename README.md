# Introduction
MaltheMCTS is a MCTS agent for Scripts of Tribute, SoT (https://github.com/ScriptsOfTribute). It was created on the foundation of AAU903Bot (https://github.com/Malthe122/SoTProject).
It was created as research for a final master project, and the paper can be accessed here at \[Insert link once its public\].
As I did not have rights to fork the SoT repository, I just pushed the content to this repository manually.
